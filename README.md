# API Testing Overview Guide

**Definition/Overview:** An Application Programming Interface (API) enables communications between multiple apps/networks by utilizing a stack of integrated technologies over sessions or connections. The role of the API can be visualized as being similar to a connector: it 'plugs' a network as a data source/provider to another network that requests data on another 'side' (as a client).

**Who needs it?:** Web and streaming (e.g., videos, music) services are heavily dependent upon API systems to serve their consumers. In many cases, a consumer on the 'front end' (the part of a system that the user directly sees and interacts with) utilizes an interface (such as a web page) to request data from the 'back end' (the data part of the system that the user does not directly interact with, such as SQL and NoSQL databases) and its services. The API performs like a messenger that listens to the user's requests (such as desiring for a movie to appear on their television screen), informs the server network's technology of what it needs to do to satisfy the request, and then serves back the data response that the client requested (in this example, the movie).

TODO: Add information on how testing works (using Postman software as a tool), HTTP methods, and SOAP and REST API systems.
